Artificial intelligence is the behavior and specific characteristics of computer programs that allow them to mimic human mental capabilities,
 their working patterns, and the way they simulate life.  Among the most important of these characteristics is the ability to learn, infer, 
 think about the situation and react to situations that were not programmed in God, but rather depend on the way the machine deals with the situation.
 However, this term is controversial due to the lack of a specific definition of intelligence
 And artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science.  Many AI processes are defined as “studying and designing smart clients”,
 and a smart customer is a system that absorbs its environment and takes situations that increase its chance of success in achieving its mission or the mission of its team
We can say with a simply way that artificial intelligence term (AI) to systems or devices that emulate human intelligence to perform some tasks that can automatically improve without interference in this depending on the information they collect.
 Some applications in which the scenic intelligence robots are used to understand customer problems faster and provide more efficient answers to artificial intelligence using it to analyze important information from a wide range of text data to improve scheduling Although artificial intelligence provides images of high-performance robots similar to human control,
 but it is not aimed at replacing human beings. It is aimed at strengthening capacities and human contributions. Making it originally a great value of business assets
